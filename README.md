# Team Anvesha - Encode Hackathon

This project is an AI-powered phone agent designed to handle cold calls, engage in meaningful conversations, and assist in closing sales. The solution utilizes Smallest.ai APIs for natural voice generation and chatbot responses, and is implemented as a smartwatch application for prototype purposes, providing an innovative user experience.
## Features

- **Talk and Listen**: The AI agent can listen to and respond to user interactions, simulating a real conversation.
- **Natural Conversations**: The chatbot uses natural-sounding voices and holds meaningful interactions, simulating human-like conversations.
- **Sales Closure**: The agent is designed to close sales by addressing customer needs and providing solutions.
- **Low Latency and High Performance**: The system is optimized for fast performance with minimal delay during voice interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Smartwatch AI Chatbot**: A custom-built chatbot powered by the NVIDIA API for conversation responses.
- **Voice Interaction**: Smallest.ai API is used to generate natural and human-like voice responses.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Backend server handling API requests and chatbot logic.
- **NVIDIA API**: For creating intelligent chatbot conversations.
- **Smallest.ai API**: For generating realistic, natural voice interactions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_name>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```bash
   SMALLEST_API_KEY=<your_smallest_api_key>
   NVIDIA_API_KEY=<your_nvidia_api_key>
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open the application on your smartwatch or use a compatible emulator to test the functionality.

## How It Works

1. **Cold Calling**: The agent initiates a cold call by analyzing a list of potential customers. It uses natural voice and interaction patterns to engage the user.
2. **Engaging Conversations**: The chatbot, powered by the NVIDIA API, responds intelligently to customer queries, answering questions and providing solutions.
3. **Sales Closing**: The AI agent recognizes when the conversation has reached a point where it can close the sale, offering final solutions or products to the customer.
4. **Smartwatch Experience**: The app is designed to work seamlessly on a smartwatch, providing a smooth, compact interaction with the AI agent.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Voice Modulation**: Enhance the voice experience to reflect different tones and emotions.
- **Extended Customer Segmentation**: Add more advanced filters for targeting specific customer types.
- **Integration with CRM Systems**: Link the chatbot to customer management systems for better data tracking.
